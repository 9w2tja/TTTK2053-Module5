#TASK 1 : Explain the differences between Programming Languages and Scripting Languages ?
#1 - Scripted languages are interpreted within another program (like JavaScript is put within HTML and then interpreted by the browser). Programmed languages are compiled into a more compact form that does not need to be interpreted by another application in the same way. The compiled result is stand-alone.
#2 - A scripted language like JavaScript can be edited in a text editor; this works together with the fact that JS source code is accessible by viewing the source of the HTML file in the browser.
#3 - Scripted languages may tend to be easier to learn, and can take less code to get something done. Partly this is because programming languages may have more traditional structures and sometimes more rigorous or complex concerns to address.

#Task 2: Explain the reasons to learn Python ?
# - Beginner Friendliness (Easy to Understand & Very Flexible)
# - Scalability (Not Easy to Maintain & Slow)
# - Community (5th Largest StackOverflow Community, 3rd Largest Meetup Community, 4th Most-Used Language at GitHub)
# - Career Opportunities


# Task 3 : Write 'Hello World' with Python
print("Hello World")
